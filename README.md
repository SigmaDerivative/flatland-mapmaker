## Controls

- `0-9` and `+` while hovering is for creating the railways
- `left-click` changes the picture of the tile (through all the pictures)
- `right-click` rotates the tile
- `Space` is for getting output for flatland (the output is in the terminal)
- `Enter` is for getting raw output (to be pasted if you want to rework more on the map)

Difference between space and enter is that space gives output of 0-10 and degree which are the railways and the stations as tuple position as own array.
Enter gives it in the same array with numbers 0-16, which gives error if pasted to flatland, but is needed to get stations on reload of railgen.
